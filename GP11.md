# Guided Practice 11: Investigation 6

## Preview

In our next class, we will start Investigation 6, which focuses on algebra in other number systems. We have gotten a taste of what Investigation 6 is about when we studied algebra in $\mathbb{Z}_n$, the system of congruence classes of integers modulo $n$ along with the special addition and multiplication operations we defined for those classes. Here, we will look at several other “number” systems and investigate what aspects of algebra and arithmetic still work. Those systems include the rational numbers, the complex numbers, $n\times n$ matrices, and collections of sets. We will be connecting the new content back to the arithmetic axioms from Investigation 1 and some of the algebraic properties of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ we saw in Investigation 5.

## Reading

Read all of Investigation 6, pages __63--74__ in the textbook. Review the main concepts of Investigations 1–5 as needed.

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. The Concept Checks will cover the objectives of __CC.9__ and __CC.10__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of the __congruence class of an integer $a$ modulo $n$__, and given values of $a$ and $n$ list several elements of the congruence class of  $a$ modulo $n$.
+ Define the term __binary relation__.
+ State the definition of an __equivalence relation__ on a nonempty set $S$. In particular, state the three properties a binary relation on $S$ must satisfy in order to be an equivalence relation.
+ State the definition of the __equivalence class__ of an element $a$ of a set $S$ with respect to an equivalence relation $\sim$.
+ State the three main results of Theorem 5.6.
+ Define the integers modulo $n$ (that is, $\mathbb{Z}_n$) for an integer $n\ge 2$.
+ Explain how to “add” and “multiply” two objects in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Note that the objects in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are not numbers but sets, so this is not a no-brainer.
+ Define the term __Cartesian product__ $S\times S$ of a set $S$ with itself; and given a set $S$, list several elements of $S\times S$.
+ Define the term binary operation on a set $S$.
+ Define what it means for a binary operation on a set $S$ to be __well-defined__.
+ Define the terms __zero divisor__, __unit__, and __multiplicative inverse__ of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
+ For a specific, small value of $n$, determine which elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are units and which are zero divisors, and if an element is a unit then find its multiplicative inverse.
+ Identify algebraic properties satisfied by general number systems (including subsets of the real numbers, the complex numbers, square matrices, and set collections).
+ State the definition of the sets $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$, and the Gaussian Integers.
+ Find the power set of a set $S$ and the symmetric difference of two sets.


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

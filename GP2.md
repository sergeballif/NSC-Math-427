# Guided Practice 2: Investigation 2

## Preview

In our next class we will begin looking at __divisibility properties of the integers__. We’ll begin with a formal definition of what it means for one integer to divide another and then introduce the all-important __Division Algorithm__. We will especially focus on producing a rigorous proof of the Division Algorithm, which requires another important concept – the __Well-Ordering Principle__.

## Reading

In your textbook, read pages __15–24 starting from the beginning of Investigation 2 up to (but not including) the section titled “Congruence”__. (Integer congruence will be the focus of our next class, so if you want to skim ahead, that would help you later, but it’s not necessary for now.) Note that the items labelled “Activity” and the proof of the Division Algorithm will be the focus of our work in class, so you do not need to complete these before class – just be familiar with what is in those items.

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. We will not re-teach these in class, although after the Concept Check quiz we will have time for questions and answers on them. (The Concept Check quiz will be drawn from objectives __CC 1__ and __CC 2__). The new learning objectives in Investigation 2 are the following:

+ State the definition of “divides” (i.e., what it means for one integer to divide another).
+ Given two integers $a$ and $b$, determine if $a$ divides $b$. If so, state the integer $q$ such that $b = aq$.
+ State the Division Algorithm. (Be precise and include all parts.)
+ Given two integers $a$ and $b$ (with $a > 0$), state the integers $q$ and $r$ such that $b=aq+r$ and $0\le r<a$.
+ State the Well-Ordering Principle.
+ Given a set, determine whether the set has a least element (and state that least element, if it exists).

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Work through Preview Activity 2.1 parts (a), (b), and (c). You do not need to show work or explain your answers, but do please indicate which question you are answering.
2. Work through Preview Activity 2.1 parts (d), (e), and (f). Give both your answers and a very brief explanation for each.
3. Work through Preview Activity 2.2 parts (c), (d), and (e). Give both your answers and a very brief explanation for each.
4. Work through Preview Activity 2.4 parts (a), (b), and (c).

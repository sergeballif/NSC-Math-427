# Guided Practice 7: Investigation 4

## Preview

Investigation 4 is about prime factorization. We will first discuss the concept of a prime number and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic which states that every natural number has a unique prime factorization. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic allows us to take any natural number and write it in terms of a product of basic building blocks, and the primes are those building blocks. In a twist at the end, we will take up our first question about abstraction: Is it possible to define a “prime object” in other algebraic systems? We will save the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic until the next class period.

## Reading

In your textbook, review pages __33–40__. 

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. There will be no Concept Check no this day. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of __prime number__ and __composite number__.
+ List at least 10 prime numbers, at least one of which is greater than three digits in length.
+ State the __Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic__.
+ Given a natural number, write out its prime factorization.
+ Outline the overall strategy and steps used in a proof by mathematical induction.
+ Given an assertion that is to be proven by mathematical induction, clearly state the base case, the hypothesis of the induction step, and the conclusion of the inductive step.
+ State __Euclid’s Lemma__ (both the “weak” form on page 36 and the “strong” form on page 37).

## Induction Videos

This Investigation uses heavily the concept of a proof by mathematical induction, and we will assume in class that all students have basic fluency with the concept and overall strategy of induction proofs. Watch the two videos below for a quick review.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

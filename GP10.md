# Guided Practice 10: Investigation 5

## Preview

We will first look at the concept of congruence classes of integers modulo $n$, which is a way of grouping together integers that are congruent to each other and treating the entire group as one object. We then look at a generalization of this idea in the notion equivalence relations and equivalence classes. Armed with these ideas we define a new “number system” $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and define two binary operations on this system, creating a new, finite, self-contained algebra world. Within this system we will begin to ask questions about how algebra is done, namely about the existence of zero divisors, units, and multiplicative inverses.

## Reading

In your textbook, review pages __45--58__. 

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. The Concept Checks will cover the objectives of __CC.9__ and __CC.10__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of the __congruence class of an integer $a$ modulo $n$__, and given values of $a$ and $n$ list several elements of the congruence class of  $a$ modulo $n$.
+ Define the term __binary relation__.
+ State the definition of an __equivalence relation__ on a nonempty set $S$. In particular, state the three properties a binary relation on $S$ must satisfy in order to be an equivalence relation.
+ State the definition of the __equivalence class__ of an element $a$ of a set $S$ with respect to an equivalence relation $\sim$.
+ State the three main results of Theorem 5.6.
+ Define the integers modulo $n$ (that is, $\mathbb{Z}_n$) for an integer $n\ge 2$.
+ Explain how to “add” and “multiply” two objects in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Note that the objects in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are not numbers but sets, so this is not a no-brainer.
+ Define the term __Cartesian product__ $S\times S$ of a set $S$ with itself; and given a set $S$, list several elements of $S\times S$.
+ Define the term binary operation on a set $S$.
+ Define what it means for a binary operation on a set $S$ to be __well-defined__.
+ Define the terms __zero divisor__, __unit__, and __multiplicative inverse__ of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
+ For a specific, small value of $n$, determine which elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are units and which are zero divisors, and if an element is a unit then find its multiplicative inverse.


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Determine whether each relation is an equivalence relation. Test all three properties even if you find one that fails.
  * For integers $a$ and $b$, $a\frown b$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same tens digit.
  * Let $a$ and $b$ be people. Then define $a\perp b$ if $a$ and $b$ are the same age. 
  * Two points in the plane are related by $\sim$ if they are less than $5$ units apart.
  * Two points in the plane are related by $\approx$ if they share the same $x$-coordiante.
  * For integers $a$ and $b$, $a\mid b$ if $b$ is a multiple of $a$.
2. For each relation in problem 1 that was an equivalence relation describe the equivalence classes for that equivalence relation.

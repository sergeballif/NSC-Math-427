# Specifications for Student Work in Math 453

## Why writing matters in Math 453

A primary goal of Math 453 is to continue to develop your ability to communicate in mathematics. Effective written communication is a central goal of the course and we will treat it with an appropriate level of attention through the work we do.

## Specifications for Pass/No Pass work on Guided Practice, Concept Quizzes, CORE Assessments, and Leading Discussions

The rules for determining Pass/No Pass work are more straightforward than the rules for attaining Mastery/Progressing/Novice. 
+ A __Pass__ on Guided Practice is awarded to responses to Guided Practice items in which __a good-faith effort to be right is given on all items, and the work is submitted at the beginning of class__. A __No Pass__ is awarded if the submission is turned in after the deadline. A __No Pass__ is also awarded if at least one item in the exercise set is blank or does not show evidence of a good-faith effort to be correct, for example if the response is "I don't know". 
+ A __Pass__ on a Concept Check is awarded if you answer at least 4 questions correct out of 5; otherwise the mark is __No Pass__. 
+ __CORE__ problems may consist of multiple parts. To achieve a __Pass__ you must complete each item of a problem using proper notation and terminology. Moreover, your solution must be correct, and your work must show that you fully grasp the concept. Minor errors are tolerable because of the time constraints, but gibberish work, logical gaps, or miss-used terminology will result in a mark of __No Pass__.
+ A __Pass__ is awarded for leading a discussion on the Guided Practice exercise at the beginning of class if your presentation consists of legible work that results from a good-faith effort, and you are able to answer questions about your work and field questions from others.


## Specifications for work on Mastery Problems and Teaching Items

__All Master Problems (homework) and Teaching items in MTH 310 are to be typed up using a word processor or typesetting system that can render mathematical notation in a professional-looking way__. The two best options are LaTeX or Microsoft Word using Equation Editor. I strongly encourage you to use LaTeX, since it’s the easiest platform to use (once you climb the initial learning curve), produces the best-looking results, and is a standard tool for math and science people in writing professional documents. If you have never used LaTeX before, I recommend two useful tools for getting started:

The Introduction to LaTeX playlist at the GVSU Mathematics Department’s YouTube channel, and
writeLaTeX, which is a free, cloud-based LaTeX platform that requires no installation and has some nice features.
Additionally, I have made up a couple of simple LaTeX templates for both homework and portfolio writeups:

Mastery Problems are completed as weekly homework assignments, and Teaching Items are projects that allow you to demonstrate mastery of CORE objectives at a deeper level. Mastery Problems and Teaching Items differ from other work in the class in that they are completed in an untimed environment. These problems involve written communication, and not just giving answers to problems. Therefore the specifications for work on these items are more complex and focus mainly on writing, communication, and style. 

## General Comments for Mastery level work on Mastery Problems and Teaching Items

Attaining Mastery level on one of these items requires that you be aware of the four different kinds of error that can occur when doing significant work in mathematics. 

1. __Computational error__. This occurs when a mathematical computation (calculus, algebra, arithmetic, etc.) is incorrectly carried out, either by hand or on a computer. For example: Given the equaton $3x = 9$ and arriving at $x = 2$ is a computational error. 
2. __Logical error__. A logical error occurs when a conclusion is drawn erroneously from a set of information. For example: Given the equation $x^2 = 9$ and concluding that x must be positive is a logical error. In calculus, if you are given the derivative equation $f'(5) = 0$, and then conclude that f must have a local extreme value at $x = 5$, this is a logical error. 
3. __Syntax error__. Syntax errors occur in one of two ways. First, they can occur as errors in English grammar, when the rules for language usage are not followed correctly, especially to the point that they obscure the thought process in the solution or introduce new errors. Second, they can occur as errors in the usage of mathematical notation, especially if the misuse of notation obscures the solution or introduces new errors. For example, in calculus the misuse of the pronoun "it" without clear reference to an antecedent is a particular problem (example: "It is increasing because it is positive"). In mathematical notation, syntax errors can be caused by switching variables mid-solution (for example, solving $3t = 9$ to get $x = 3$ is an error); by misusing function notation, mismatching parentheses, and a host of other possibilities. 
4. __Semantic error__. Semantic errors occur when the rules of the _grammar_ of a language are followed but the resulting statements are nonsensical or meaningless. For example, the statement "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is correct English syntax but has no meaning, therefore it represents a semantic error. In mathematics, a similarly semantically erroneous statement would be "The following graph can be factored". This is a semantic error because we don't "factor" graphs; we factor polynomials and integers, and to say we are "factoring a graph" is meaningless.

In reality, these errors are closely linked together, and an error in one category usually introduces an error in one of the others. The general rule for Math 453 is: __Work on Mastery Problems and Teaching Items must be almost, if not  entirely free of all of the above kinds of error in order to be assessed as Mastery level; and there can be no significant instances of any of these errors.__ That is, a small number of minor errors can be tolerated as long as they do not make the answer incorrect or significantly obscure the thought process in the solution. But large numbers of minor errors, or a single instance of a major error, will result in the work being marked as _Progressing_ at best.

For these items, we will often refer to the __standard audience for Math 453__, which is defined to be: 

>The standard audience in Math 453 consists of classmates in Math 453 who are familiar with the mathematical ideas discussed in the class and have the appropriate background knowledge for the class, but who are unfamiliar with the particular problem whose solution you are presenting and therefore need to be persuaded that your solution is correct and your conclusions believable. 

Therefore some items will not need to be discussed in a solution; for example, you can perform basic arithmetic or algebra computations without showing any work. On the other hand you should remind the reader of key definitions and assumptions when proving results. 

## Evaluation of Master Problem Solutions

Homework problems are generally aimed at demonstrating your ability to apply, analyze, and evaluate course concepts. Some creative activity, such as constructing mathematical proofs, may also be included. In general you will see a variety of tasks on homework, ranging from the very simple to moderately complex (intended to ramp you up into a portfolio problem with a similar topic).

Homework problems will have a wide tange of complexity and difficulty. A Mastery problem will receive a __Mastery__ score if each of the four criteria below (the __C__'s) can be answered affirmatively. 

- __Completeness__. Has every aspect of the problem been throroughly addressed?  
- __Correctness__. Is the work mathematically correct? Does it demonstrate a thorough grasp of the underlying concepts?
- __Clarity__. Does the work employ proper standards of mathematical communication, including the correct use of the English language, mathematical terminology, and mathematical notation?
- __Coherence__. Is the solution sufficiently justified using correct logic and valid mathematical argumentation? Are all steps in the solution warranted and explained properly?

Note that these criteria are not mutually exclusive. For example, an unwarranted step in a solution will affect both the completeness of the solution and its clarity.

Problems that shows significant progress in at least 3 of the 4 criteria will receive a __Progressing__ score. Any work that falls significantly below the standards in 2 or more of the critera will receive a __Novice__ score. 

## Evaluation of Teaching Items

Teaching Items are projects where you prepare a lesson for your fellow classmates that demonstrates your mastery a specific __CORE__ objective and your understanding of its significance. A teaching item that receives a score of __Mastery__ will 

- introduce the __CORE__ problem concept in an unambiguous way,
- contain a full solution of a specific problem, 
- include exposition on possible variations or more general cases,
- demonstrate good pedagogy at an appropriate level for the standard Math 453 audience, and
- satisfy the standards of the four __C__ criteria for Mastery Problems.

A Teaching Item that fails to demonstrate a complete understanding of the __CORE__ objective or that is weak in its explanations will receive a score of __Progressing__. A Teaching item that is targeted at the wrong audience or that has significant errors or omissions in the explanation will receive a mark of __Novice__.

## Ten Things you need to know about Math 453

1. I want you to be successful in the class. My job is to help you learn and develop a deep understanding of the course material. I am on your side! I would like our relationship to be like that between a client and a consultant who work together to achieve an end goal. Please feel free to come speak with me at any time. 
2. I expect you to be actively engaged in your learning. In order to learn mathematics, you have to do mathematics. In Math 453 you’ll be expected to work actively, and contribute to others’ work. There is very little lecture during class time; instead we’ll be solving puzzles and asking and answering questions.
3. You’re expected to spend significant time working on this class. For an upper level course, NSC expects a ratio of 3:1 of time spent outside class to time spent in class, so that’s about 9 hours a week of purposeful work outside of class for Math 453. You might need more, if your proof background is weak.
4. This is an advanced, proof-based, abstract subject. In this class we will study abstract ideas, and problem solving in abstraction is almost always done in the form of conjectures and proof. We will see computation and examples, but you won’t be able to use examples as “templates”. You will be writing proofs and lots of them.
5. Preparation for class and fluency with basic concepts before coming to class is essential for success. You’ll be expected to prepare for class by reading your textbook, doing basic exercises, and answering questions before we meet. If you don’t prepare for class, you won’t be able to participate in the in-class work and therefore you won't have the foundation for doing other work in the class. Take preparation seriously!
6. This course uses a points-free, competenc-based grading system. Each student chooses the grade he or she wants to earn in the course and then works through assignments to demonstrate the level of competency that grade requires. Your grade is based on demonstrated competency, not on the accumulation of points.
7. You will have opportunities to demonstrate mastery repeatedly on each objective throughout the semester. You will have the chance to revise many of the items you submit for assessment. In return, you are expected to master the concepts in those items and not just get things mostlyright.
8. Most work in this class is graded on a pass/no pass basis, so careful attention to the specifications for acceptable work is a must. Work in the class is marked on the basis of whether it passes a set of specifications for professionally acceptable work. It’s quite possible to earn Pass grades on every assessment item the first time, but this requires paying attention to your work and giving a strong effort to it.
9. Academic honesty is taken very seriously. We have simple and rigorously enforced policies in Math 453 to ensure that the work you are submitting is your own. All violations of these policies, no matter how seemingly small, have serious repercussions. Make it a goal to ask for help instead of bending the rules.
10. You may ask a question about anything at any time, especially in office hours. The material in this course is not necessarily easy, and at some point you will get stuck or frustrated. Don’t panic. Instead, seek out help. If you cannot make my office hours, you can always schedule an appointment and I will try to meet you. I won’t do your work for you, but I will help you ask the right kinds of questions that will help you get unstuck.

## Assessment and Grading

This course uses a points-free, competency-based assessment system that differs from traditional pointsbased systems in some very important ways. It is designed to provide you with control over the grading process, transparency as to your progress toward a course grade, and a final course grade that truly reflects your actual mastery of course concepts.

__Learning Objectives:__ The entire course is organized around a list of Learning Objectives that specify individual
tasks that demonstrate mastery of various items in the course. These objectives fall into three categories:

- Concept Check (__CC__) objectives that address basic terminology, results, and computations;
- Module (__M__) objectives that address higher-level tasks such as analysis, application, and creative work
through programming or proof writing; and
- Core Module (__CORE M__) objectives, which are a subset of the list of M objectives that are especially
important for the course.

There are 30 CC objectives, and 37 M objectives, and 19 CORE M objectives within the list of M objectives in the course, a full list of which is provided on the [course objectives page](NSC-Math-453/CourseObjectives.html). The object of the course for each student is to demonstrate mastery on as many learning objectives as possible.










__Methods of Assessment:__ Your mastery of the learning objectives is measured through different means:
● Mastery of the CC objectives will be assessed through Concept Checks, which are quizzes given roughly
once a week in class.
● Your mastery of the M objectives will be assessed through Learning Modules, which are bundles of
problems that are grouped around a particular theme and done individually outside of class. There are nine
modules based on the content of the course plus two additional modules (Getting Started and Tech
Competency). There are twelve Learning Modules planned for the course.
● Finally, your mastery of the COREM
objectives will be assessed through problems (one problem for each
COREM
objective) done during timed assessment periods in class.
Additionally, all students will complete Class Preparation assignments to ensure adequate preparation for each
class. Class Preparation involves reading the textbook, working with simple exercises and examples, and submitting
work on these plus questions you have. At the beginning of each class meeting, one student will be selected to
present his or her work on the Class Preparation and lead a discussion on the material.
Method of marking: Generally speaking, each assessment item is marked on a twolevel
scale: either Pass or No
Pass, on the basis of whether or not the work satisfies a list of specifications for acceptable work.
● For Class Preparation, you receive a mark of Pass if (and only if) each item you are asked to submit
provides evidence of a goodfaith
effort to give a correct answer. If you are asked to present your work, a
successful presentation consists of presenting legible work that results from a goodfaith
effort, and you are
able to answer questions about your work and field questions from others.
● On Concept Checks, each CC objective is assessed by a single item to be completed. These usually are
objective items such as stating definitions, multiplechoice,
true/false, fillintheblank,
or simple calculations
where only the answer is checked. You will Pass a CC objective if you answer correctly, and receive No
Pass otherwise.
● On COREM
objectives assessed during a timed assessment period, each individual objective is given a
separate problem to work that assesses it. Your work is marked Pass or No Pass using a simplified list of
specifications based on the larger list of specifications for Modules.
● On Learning Modules (untimed), we use a threelevel
scale: Pass, Progressing, or No Pass. A mark of
Pass is reserved for a submission for a module that meets the specifications for professionally acceptable
work throughout the entire submission. A mark of Progressing is for work that meets many of the
specifications but has a small number of critical errors or otherwise fails to meet specifications but
it’s
close. No Pass is given to work that does not reach the level of Progressing.
Timed assessment periods: At four different times during the semester, we will set aside the entire class period for
you to attempt problems aimed at the 24 COREM
objectives. Before each timed assessment period, you will be
surveyed as to which COREM
objectives you would like to be assessed on during that period. You may attempt as
many or as few as you like. For all the ones you select, you will receive a problem that assesses that COREM
objective. If your work on a timed problem is Passing, then you have demonstrated mastery on that learning
objective, and you will not be tested on it again. If your work does Not Pass, then you can elect to try a new instance
of that problem at a later timed assessment period. You may also elect to be reassessed
on CC objectives during
timed assessment periods if you have not passed some of those; as with COREM
objectives, you will need to
specify which CC objectives you want to be assessed on in advance.
The table below shows the requirements necessary for each letter grade. To earn the grade listed in each row, a
student must satisfy ALL the criteria in that row.






## Assigned Work
The work you do in the course has two purposes: To help you make sense of the concepts you are supposed to know, and to assess how well you have mastered the learning objectives of the course. These items of work include:

* __Guided Practice:__ These are structured activities that guide you (by questions that you answer) through reading, viewing, and other preparatory activities on new content.
* __WeBWorK Homework:__ For each section there will be about a dozen homework problems to complete using WeBWorK.  These exercises focus on computational skill and basic conceptual  understanding and build upon your first contact with Calculus material you gain
through Guided Practice.
* __WeBWorK Journal:__ Students will record their work on WeBWorK homework problems following the guidelines of the document [WeBWorK Homework Journal Guidelines](NSC-Math-181/Math181WeBWorK.pdf)
* __Daily Quizze## Course Learning Outcomes
A successful MTH 201 will demonstrate evidence of mastery of each of the following learning  outcomes:

* Perform basic limit, derivative, and integral symbolic computations correctly and fluently by hand.
* Compute the tangent line to a function at a specific point on its graph.
* Compute the area between the graph of a function and the horizontal axis.
* State the formal definition of the derivative and explain the purpose of the symbols in the definition.
* State the formal definition of the definite integral as a Riemann sum and explain the purpose of the symbols in the definition.
* State and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 
* Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of the slope of a tangent line and as an instantaneous rate of change in a function.
* Interpret the meaning of a definite integral in terms of total change in a function and in terms of signed area.
* Draw conclusions about the limit, derivative, or integral of a function by examining a function in symbolic, graphical, and numerical/data representations.
* Solve problems that require the use of derivatives to extract useful information and apply it within a larger context, such as in optimization and related rates problems.
* Apply basic knowledge about calculus to new problems.
* Communicate the results of a problem clearly, correctly, and in a manner appropriate to the audience.
* Use a variets:__ At the beginning of each class period where we begin lecture on a new section we will have a quiz to assess how well you have mastered the material of the previous day.
* __Problems:__ The objectives of the course can be broken down into 17 distinct types of problems. Samples of these 17 types are posted to the Blackboard site. Within these 17 types are 6 types that are labeled core , and 10 that are outside the core. These problems are more complex and challenging than those found on Guided Practice, Online Homework, or Concept Quizzes and include elements of each of these. Your ability to solve these problems will be assessed through four Midterm Exams and a Final Exam, described more fully below.
* __Miniprojects:__  In addition to the Problems, eight miniprojects that involve using course technology are available, with 4 of those 8 labelled as core and 4 more outside the core. Miniprojects focus on realworld applications and the use of realworld data and, especially, the use of technology to model and solve problems involving calculus.
* __Teaching Items:__ Finally, to demonstrate mastery of core objectives students will be asked to create three lessons that show that they have mastered the material and are able to communicate it in a thorough and efficient way to an audience of their classmates. Students can complete one project of the types
 - __Texting Lesson__ Students can create a mock question-and-answer session where a teacher teaches the students one of the core lessons of the class.
 - __Video Lesson__ The student will create a screencast video (or some other type of lesson video) summarizing one of the sections of the book.
 - __Desmos Activity__ Students will create a Desmos account at https://teacher.desmos.com and create a lesson activity that illustrates one of the core objectives of the class.

__Grading System__
Math 181 uses a **points-free mastery-based grading system** that is designed to provide you with control over the grading process, transparency as to your progress toward a course grade, and a final course grade that truly reflects your actual mastery of course concepts. Our grading system works as follows:

* At the beginning of the semester, you will be asked to decide on the target grade you plan to earn for the course. This does not need to be an “A”. You’ll be asked to carefully consider your goals, skill set, life situation, academic needs, and so on before stating your target grade. For some students, a “B” or even a “C” is perfectly sufficient and realistic, relative to their situation.
* **The means of assessing your graded work in the class is done without using points**. Instead, your work is graded on a two-level scale of **Pass/No Pass** or on a three level scale of **Mastery/Progressing/Novice**. Whenever you submit work to be graded, I will employ my best professional judgment along with a clear list of specifications for categorizing that work. The specifications for your work are provided in a separate document, and you should make yourself intimately familiar with that document. Your Guided Practice, WeBWorK Homework, WeBWorK Journals, and Daily Quizzes are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis; Problems, Miniprojects, and Teaching Items are graded using Mastery/Progressing/Novice designations.
* The grade you earn at the end of the semester is determined by counting the number of items in each category that you complete at an acceptable level . There are no points involved and no statistical or numerical calculations.

The table for determining your grade is given below. For reference: there are a total of 24 problems and miniprojects, 10 of which are considered core and 14 of which are outside the core. Also, there will be 27 daily quizzes, 27 guided practice assignments, and 220 points of online homework. “Pass” means the following:

* _Guided Practice_: “Pass” means that all questions to be submitted have been submitted before the
deadline, with a goodfaith effort to be right. Correctness of the answers is not factored in.
* _Daily Quiz_: “Pass” means a score of at least 8 out of 10.
* _WeBWorK Journal_: “Pass” means a score of at least 25 out of 30 as outlined in the document [WeBWorK Journal Guidelines](NSC-Math-181/Math181WeBWorK.pdf).
All other descriptions of Passing, Mastery, Progressing, or Novice level work are explained in the Specifications for Student Work document, posted separately.

__Plus/Minus grading:__ In case not all of your attainments in the class are at the same grade level, we will figure plus/minus grades as follows. Note there are seven overall categories of work you will do: Getting Started, Guided Practice, Daily Quizzes, WeBWorK Homework, WeBWorK Journal, Problems/Miniprojects, and Teaching Items.  First, find your category at which you have attained the lowest level of work. If that is the only category at this level, you will receive a “minus” grade for the next level up . Otherwise (more than one category at that lowest level) you will receive a “plus” grade at this level .

* Example : A student who has passed Getting Started (passed 23 Guided Practice assignments (B level), 16 Daily Quizzes (C level), scored 188 points on WeBWorK (B level), passed two WeBWorK Journals (B level) attained mastery on all 10 core problems/miniprojects but only 6 more problems/miniprojects (B level) and completed 2 Teaching Items (B level) receives a B-- since the Daily Quizzes level was the lowest level but the only one at that level.
![A Grade Checklist](images/GradeChecklistExample1.PNG)
* Example : A student who has passed Getting Started (passed 24 Guided Practice assignments (“B” level), 22 Daily Quizzes (“A” level), scored 206 points on WeBWorK (“A” level), passed three WeBWorK Journals (“A” level) attained mastery on all 10 core problems/miniprojects but only 6 more problems/miniprojects (“B” level) and completed 3 Teaching Items (“B” level) receives a B+ since there were two components at a B level while all the others were at A level. 
![A Grade Checklist](images/GradeChecklistExample2.PNG)

Please note that NSC does not award grades of A+ or D-.

__Revisions:__ Instead of partial credit, you will receive numerous opportunities to revise and resubmit work that does not meet the specifications for Passing or Mastery. Specifically: 

* Online homework gives instant feedback on correctness when you submit it. **You are allowed unlimited reattempts on every online homework item** until the due date.
* **Each Daily Quiz can be attempted twice without penalty** (an initial attempt + one reattempt in my office). Further reattempts can be “purchased” using tokens (see below).
* Problems are assessed on Midterm and Final exams. Each of the Midterm Exams past the first one as well as the Final Exam is cumulative . The first midterm exam will have four problems on it, the second one eight problems, the third around twelve, and the fourth midterm and final will include all 17 problems. **In this way if you do not perform well on a problem on one midterm exam, you can try again on a subsequent one.** Conversely, once you finish enough problems at Mastery level for the grade you want, you can opt out of the exams. It’s not uncommon for many students not to take the final exam because they have already “leveled up” to their target grade by the time of the exam.
* **Any miniproject submission that does not attain Mastery level can be revised and resubmitted for regrading.** You can submit up to one miniproject per week for regrading (in addition to any new submissions). Miniprojects that attain Progressing level can be resubmitted without penalty. Miniprojects assessed at Novice level can be resubmitted if you spend a token (below).
* 
_Note_: Guided Practice assignments may not be revised or submitted late. These must be completed at the stated deadline or they receive a permanent No Pass.

__Tokens:__ Each student will be given five “tokens” at the beginning of the term. Each token can be cashed in for one of the following:  

* A revision of a Miniproject that was assessed at Novice level.
* A third attempt of a Quiz.
* A 24-hour extension on any Midterm Exam, Miniproject, WeBWorK set, or Teaching Item, or the Getting Started assignment. If you choose to use a token for a deadline extension, you must inform me prior to the original deadline (which is 11:59pm EDT Sunday) and the new deadline will become 11:59pm EDT Monday. Submissions given after the extended deadline are not accepted.  

Opportunities to earn additional tokens may be given during the semester.

__Notes about this grading system:__ The advantages of this grading system are numerous:

* It focuses course work away from point-scoring, which is counterproductive to learning, and focuses instead on whether or not your work meets professional quality standards.
* It places control of your grade firmly in your hands so that you don’t have to “hope” for a grade.
* It directly links the grade you earn to the amount and quality of work that you do.
* It gives a final grade that communicates real information about your mastery of the subject.
* Finally, it allows you to be graded on what you eventually master, so that early missteps do not have to have a major negative future impact.
 
The chief downside to this system is that it’s complicated. You can download my [sample gradebook](images/SampleGradebook.xlsx) to track your progress through the course to help make it easier. And if you have any questions or concerns about the system, please let me know.

## What are the consequences of missing class?

If you miss class you will miss out on the daily quiz. The quiz will only be given to students in class; you will need to use one of your tokens if you want to take a quiz outside of class. If you miss class, then you will also miss out on the lecture and activities. One possible way to catch up on the material that was covered during class is to watch the lecture recording which can be accessed by clicking on the mediasite tab in Canvas. However, you should only think of the recorded lecture as a backup because there are occasionally technical problems.

Note that the style of this class is a partially flipped class, so you will do much of your learning by reading and watching videos outside of class. Much of each class period will be devoted to applying the principles and practicing the techniques that will be acquired in the out-of-class reading. You probably don’t want to miss out on the classroom discussion and activities. If you must miss class, then be sure to complete the Guided Practice prior to class.

# Guided Practice 4: Investigation 3

## Preview

Investigation 3 builds upon our work with integer arithmetic and divisibility to introduce the central concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). This is a concept we all learned as kids, but its ramifications are far-reaching. We’ll be defining the GCD carefully, developing an efficient algorithm based on the Division Algorithm for computing the GCD, and proving several theorems about the GCD. Along the way we will define the concept of relatively prime integers.

## Reading

In your textbook, read pages __23–31__. 

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. We will not re-teach these in class, although after the Concept Check quiz we will have time for questions and answers on them. The Concept Check quiz will be drawn from objectives __CC.3__ and __CC.4__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of “divides” (i.e., what it means for one integer to divide another).
+ Given two integers $a$ and $b$, determine if $a$ divides $b$. If so, state the integer $q$ such that $b = aq$.
+ State the Division Algorithm. (Be precise and include all parts.)
+ Given two integers $a$ and $b$ (with $a > 0$), state the integers $q$ and $r$ such that $b=aq+r$ and $0\le r<a$.
+ Define what it means for two integers to be congruent modulo $n$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
+ Given a positive integer $n$, determine if two integers are congruent modulo $n$.
+ Given a positive integer $n$ and some integer $a$, find a list of integers that are congruent to $a\pmod{n}$.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

# Teaching Item 1

## Getting to the Project 

Go to [overleaf.com](http://www.overleaf.com) and create an account. Once you are logged in you will see a screen that lets you create projects. First download the zip file [here](/NSC-Math-453/images/math-453-teaching.zip) and then upload it on overleaf by clicking on the arrow of the image

Now you should see a project that contains the instructions, but you need to tweak one additional setting. Click on the gear icon in the upper left corner by your username. Under the Project Settings change the LaTeX engine to be XeLaTeX. Now the project should appear. You edit the code on the left and the output gets displayed on the right. Good luck.

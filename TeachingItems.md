## Getting to the Project 

Go to [overleaf.com](http://www.overleaf.com) and create an account. Once you are logged in you will see a screen that lets you create projects. First download the zip file [here](/NSC-Math-453/images/math-453-teaching.zip) and then upload it on overleaf by clicking on the arrow of the image

Now you should see a project that contains the instructions. Good luck.

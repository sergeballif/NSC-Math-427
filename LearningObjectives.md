# Math 453 Learning Objectives	

Legend: 

+ CC = Learning objectives to be assessed through Concept Checks. 
+ M = Learning objectives to be assessed only through Learning Modules.
+ (CORE) = Learning objectives designated as belonging to the 20 CORE-M learning objectives for Modules, assessed during timed assessment periods.

To "instantiate" a definition means to construct or state examples of that definition, and to create a non-example of that definition.

==================================================

## 19: Symmetry

+ CC.1: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Rigid motion; symmetry
+ (CORE) M.1: Create or complete an operation table for symmetries of a figure. 

## 20: An Introduction to Groups

+ CC.2: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Group; Abelian group; finite/infinite order of a group; finite/infinite group; unit
+ CC.3: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 20.7
+ (CORE) M.2: Determine whether a set with a given binary operation is or is not a group. 
+ (CORE) M.3: Given a group (especially the standard examples of groups on page 285), do the following: identify the identity element; identify the inverse of a given element; perform operations in the group; determine whether it is Abelian; determine its order; and describe its group of units.

# Math 453 Learning Objectives	

Legend: 

+ CC = Learning objectives to be assessed through Concept Checks. 
+ M = Learning objectives to be assessed only through Learning Modules.
+ (CORE) = Learning objectives designated as belonging to the 20 CORE-M learning objectives for Modules, assessed during timed assessment periods.

To "instantiate" a definition means to construct or state examples of that definition, and to create a non-example of that definition. 


MTH 453 Learning Objectives in order of appearance
==================================================

## 1: Integer Arithmetic

+ CC.1: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, additive inverse.
+ (CORE) M.1: Identify and use the Axioms of Integer Arithmetic.
+ Identify and use the Ordering Axioms
+ Use the Zero Product Property (Theorem 1.10) and the Cancellation Law (Theorem 1.11) to solve equations

## 2:

+ CC.2: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: divides, Well-Ordering Principle, congruence modulo $n$.
+ Know the statement of The Division Algorithm and be able to find $q$ and $r$ for any choice of $a$ and $b$.

## 3 Greatest Common Divisors

+ CC.3: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: common divisor, greatest common divisor, linear combination, relatively prime.
+ Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers.
+ Know the statment of Bezout's Identity and use the Euclidean algorithm to write $\gcd(a,b)$ as a linear combination of nonzero integers $a$ and $b$.

## 4 Prime Factorization

+ CC.4: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: prime number, composite number, .
+ Use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to find a unique factorization of positive integer into primes.
+ Use Euclid's Lemma and Theorem 4.5 to show that one number divides another.

## 5 Equivalence Relations and $\mathbb{Z}_n$

+ CC.5: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: relation, equivalence relation, congruence class, equivalence class, integers modulo $n$, Cartesian product, binary operation, zero divisors, units, multiplicative inverses
+ Determine whether a given relation is an equivalence relation
+ Be able to use an equivalence relation to break up a set into disjoint equivalence classes.
+ Know how to carry out arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and be able to identify all zero divisors and units in $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

## 6 Algebra in Other Number Systems

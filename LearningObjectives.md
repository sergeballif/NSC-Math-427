# Math 453 Learning Objectives	

Legend: 

+ CC = Learning objectives to be assessed through Concept Checks. 
+ M = Learning objectives to be assessed only through Learning Modules.
+ (CORE) = Learning objectives designated as belonging to the 20 CORE-M learning objectives for Modules, assessed during timed assessment periods.

To "instantiate" a definition means to construct or state examples of that definition, and to create a non-example of that definition. 

## 1: Integer Arithmetic

+ CC.1: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, additive inverse.
+ (CORE) M.1: Identify and use the Axioms of Integer Arithmetic.
+ Identify and use the Ordering Axioms
+ Use the Zero Product Property (Theorem 1.10) and the Cancellation Law (Theorem 1.11) to solve equations

## 2: Divisibility of Integers

+ CC.2: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: divides, Well-Ordering Principle, congruence modulo $n$.
+ Know the statement of The Division Algorithm and be able to find $q$ and $r$ for any choice of $a$ and $b$.

## 3 Greatest Common Divisors

+ CC.3: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: common divisor, greatest common divisor, linear combination, relatively prime.
+ Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers.
+ Know the statment of Bezout's Identity and use the Euclidean algorithm to write $\gcd(a,b)$ as a linear combination of nonzero integers $a$ and $b$.

## 4 Prime Factorization

+ CC.4: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: prime number, composite number.
+ Use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to find a unique factorization of positive integer into primes.
+ Use Euclid's Lemma and Theorem 4.5 to show that one number divides another.

## 5 Equivalence Relations and $\mathbb{Z}_n$

+ CC.5: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: relation, equivalence relation, congruence class, equivalence class, integers modulo $n$, Cartesian product, binary operation, zero divisors, units, multiplicative inverses
+ Determine whether a given relation is an equivalence relation
+ Be able to use an equivalence relation to break up a set into disjoint equivalence classes.
+ Know how to carry out arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and be able to identify all zero divisors and units in $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

## 6 Algebra in Other Number Systems

+ CC.6: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: rational numbers, complex numbers, $n\times n$ matrices, power set, symmetric difference.
+ Determine whether a given algebraic property (such as closure under addition or the existence of a multiplicative identity) holds for an abstract algebraic structure (such as the set of all positive rational numbers with the usual addition and multiplication)

## 7 An Introduction to Rings

+ CC.7: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: ring, field, integral domain.
+ Given a ring (especially the standard examples of groups on page 82), do the following: identify the zero element element; identify the additive inverse of a given element; perform operations in the ring; determine whether it is commutative; determine whether the ring has a multiplicative identity; and describe any units in the ring and their multiplicative inverses; identify any zero divisors in the ring.
+ Use the properties of zero divisors and units to solve equations involving elements of a ring.

## 8 Integer Multiples and Exponents

+ CC.8: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: multiples or powers of ring elements, characteristic.
+ Know the statement of the Binomial Theorem, and be able to use the Binomial Theorem to find a coefficient of term in the expansion of a binomial expression to a power.
+ Be able to compute negative multiples or negative powers of various ring elements (or know when such things are not defined).

## 9 Integer Multiples and Exponents

+ CC.9: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: subring, subfield, direct sum of rings.
+ Use the subring test to determine whether a subset of a ring is a subring.
+ Add and multiply elements in the direct sum of rings.


## 10 Isomorphisms and Invariants
+ CC.10: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: isomorphism, isomorphic rings, well-defined function, invariant.
+ Determine whether a function between rings is a ring isomorphism.
+ Determine whether two rings are isomorphic. If they are isomorphic, then find an isomorphism. If no isomorphism exists determine why using an invariant or other property.
